Test the THETA UVC Blender driver with any software that works with a webcam. In the example
below, I am using Skype.

image::img/livestreaming/theta-uvc-skype-select.png[role="thumb" title="Testing THETA UVC Blender with Skype"]

CAUTION: Make sure you select _THETA UVC Blender_ and not _RICOH THETA S_.

NOTE: In Skype, the video does not have 360&#176; navigation (as of Oct 2016) and it will
look like a distorted rectangle. Skype is for testing only, not for use.

=== Download and Install OBS
image::img/livestreaming/obs-icon.png[role="thumb" title="OBS Studio"]

https://obsproject.com/[Download OBS]

Create a new _Scene_. Any name is fine. Click on the plus sign. Under
_Sources_, add THETA UVC Blender (any name is fine) and add
a video capture device. Right click to open the pop-up menu.

image::img/livestreaming/obs-video-capture.png[role="thumb" title="Add Video Capture Device to OBS _Sources_"]

Select _THETA UVC Blender_ as the Device. Verify that the video stream is in equirectangular format.

image::img/livestreaming/obs-device.png[role="thumb" title="Verify THETA UVC Blender works in OBS"]

TIP: If you see a black screen that says _Status:0x800705AA_, try to toggle your device between your two
webcams. If you still see the error, disconnect all other webcams or disable the webcam on your laptop
and then reboot your computer. The error above indicates that a connection is not established. See Troubleshooting
section below

Leave the Resolution/FPS Type as _Device Default_.

image::img/livestreaming/resolution-fps.png[role="thumb" title="Leave Resolution/FPS Type as Default"]

Under Settings -> Video, set the resolution to 1280x720.

image::img/livestreaming/obs-settings-video.png[role="thumb" title="Configure Resolution to 1280x720"]

NOTE: As of Oct 2016, the maximum resolution for UVC Blender is 720p. It's likely that a higher resolution
driver may be available in the future. Please check the maximum resolution and adjust your settings if needed.

Select Stretch to screen.

image::img/livestreaming/obs-stretch-to-screen.png[role="thumb"]

## Create a YouTube Live 360&#176; Event

Log into YouTube. Click on the _Upload_ button.

On YouTube, go to the _Live Control Room_ and click _Preview Stream_.

image::img/livestreaming/youtube-preview.png[role="thumb"]

You can preview the stream if you have good bandwidth. I have limited
upstream bandwidth in my office. I reduced the ingestion bandwidth,
making my resolution lower.

image::img/livestreaming/youtube-preview-test.png[role="thumb"]

When you're ready, start the stream.

image::img/livestreaming/youtube-streaming.png[role="thumb"]

## Using HDMI

Using USB output for live streaming, you will get a maximum resolution of 720p.
If you save your video files to your camera, the resolution will be 1920x1080.
If you save still images as timelapse, you can get 5376x2688, which will be displayed
as 4K on YouTube.

The THETA S has an HDMI port that can output 1920x1080 at 30fps. In order to use
this signal, you need to use something like
https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/ultrastudiothunderbolt[Blackmagicdesign UltraStudio for Thunderbolt].

Once you get the video stream onto your computer, it will be in dual-fisheye.
To get this into equirectangular, you will need to use a third-party product
such as
http://theta360.guide/showcase/ricoh-product-streambox.html[Streambox Cloud Encoder].

image::img/livestreaming/streambox-theta.png[role="thumb"]

This is the workflow.

image::img/livestreaming/streambox-workflow.png[role="thumb"]

This is a
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8TN_Vc6wL0[sample of the live stream using a THETA].

image::img/livestreaming/streambox-sample.png[role="thumb"]

This is the equipment and service list used:

* Streamed live using Streambox Cloud Encoder
* RICOH THETA S Camera
* BlackMagic UltraStudio Mini Recorder
* MacBook Pro with USB Modems
* Streambox Cloud



http://shop.videostream360.com/vr-cams-equipment/360camera[Videostream360]
advertises using THETA at 1920x1080 with HDMI. They're even selling the
THETA on their site. I am trying to get more information on this deployment.

If you have a solution for HDMI 360&#176; streaming and you've verified that it
works with the THETA, please join the
http://theta360.guide/ecosystem/[THETA Ecosystem] and
http://lists.theta360.guide/c/theta-media/ecosystem-discussion[post]
information about it.

## Using WiFi

Streaming from the THETA using WiFi is primarily of interest to developers
and hobbyists.

### Using Unity

The THETA can live stream a 640x320 MotionJPEG at 10fps over WiFi.
This is intended to preview
a picture prior to taking the picture. It's not intended for headset navigation.
The community has built some solutions to stream this low-res, low fps video
to mobile phones, primarily using Unity.

This is a short Vine video of a
https://vine.co/v/eV9XDQBEujt[demo].

image::img/livestreaming/wifi-unity.png[role="thumb" title="360&#176; video stream using WiFi"]

Here is
https://github.com/theta360developers/ThetaWifiStreaming[sample code]
of the THETA S WiFi streaming demo with Unity.

There's
http://lists.theta360.guide/t/using-ricoh-theta-live-view-with-unity/70?u=codetricity[more information]
on using Unity with the THETA.

=== Using a Raspberry Pi

A Raspberry Pi can take the video live stream from the THETA using USB
and transmit the stream to another device using WiFi. This is intended
for software developers to use as starting point.

There is
https://github.com/theta360developers/video-streaming-sample-app[sample code]
 available for both the transmission of the live stream
and the conversion of the live stream into a navigable 360 video. Both the
browser and the server applications are written in JavaScript. The server application
uses node.

image::img/livestreaming/thetaview-fisheye.png[role="thumb" title="video stream prior to conversion"]

The sample code uses JavaScript to convert the dual-fisheye video stream into
a navigable 360&#176; video. Transmission uses
https://webrtc.org/[WebRTC].

**Q: Can I stream from a drone to a headset?**

**A:** Only with expensive equipment. This is not a good use of the THETA for
recreational hobbyists.
http://lists.theta360.guide/t/using-theta-360-video-from-a-drone/133?u=codetricity[Refer to this article] for more
information.

---

**Q: Does the THETA have auto-stabilization?**

**A:** No. You'll need to use a third-party
http://lists.theta360.guide/t/theta-s-dokumentation-on-a-clasic-mc-rally/211/11?u=codetricity[gimbal].

**Q: Is anyone using the THETA 360&#176; stream for object recognition?**

**A:** Yes. Most people use the raw video from 2 fisheye spheres. Most people do not convert
to equirectangular video. Just extract a portion of the sphere and perform the
image recognition or measurement on that section. The HDMI stream has higher resolution. Most
people are using that and extracting a frame, then performing the calculation. Known applications
include facial recognition, audience emotion recognition, autonomous vehicle operation.
As just one example, the winner of the RICOH prize at the 2016 DeveloperWeek Hackathon used
the
https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api[Microsoft Emotion API] on
the dual-fisheye spheres.

**Q: Is anyone working on panoramic sound?**

**A:** Yes. There are many projects for 3D sound, including
http://lists.theta360.guide/t/panoramic-videos-with-panoramic-sounds/304?u=codetricity[SOPA],
an open source JavaScript library.

---

**Q: How do I increase the sound quality?**

**A:** Use an external microphone and add it to your mixer. Set the THETA's input
to zero using your mixer. If you're using OBS for the stream, plug your microphones into your
computer and then add a new audio source from the main dashboard to your stream.
There is no way to plug a microphone directly into the THETA.

== Troubleshooting

=== Streaming to YouTube
==== Problem: Status:0x800705AA

image::img/livestreaming/obs-error.png[role="thumb" title="Error message when device not detected"]

1. Verify your firmware is 01.42 or above
2. Make sure your camera has the blue word `Live` in LED lights on
3. Toggle between webcam and UV Blender. If this still fails to resolve the problem,
disable all other webcams and reboot
4. Try a different USB cable. Plug it into the port on the back of your computer

==== Problem: Screen is black with nothing on it

Check video resolution. Set to 1280x720

==== Problem: Video on YouTube is Equirectangular with No Navigation

If the stream is in equirectangular on OBS and it can't be navigated on YouTube, check
your YouTube configuration.

=== Heat
The unit below overheated 16 minutes into the shoot. It is using UVC Blender and a
USB cable during an indoor shoot at Stanford during a crowded VR event.

image::img/livestreaming/heat/overheat-example.png[role="thumb" title="Overheating during livestream"]

If the THETA is overheating, point a standard household fan at it. The airflow
may be enough to cool the outside of the THETA and help with the internal
overheating.

People have reported success by sticking $6 Raspberry Pi heatsinks onto the body of the THETA or
taping or attaching a small fan used for computer CPUs to the outside of the THETA.
