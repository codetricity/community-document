== Connect Camera to Computer
Plug the camera into your computer with a micro USB cable. It will appear as a normal

The data is in MotionJPEG format.

CAUTION: Make sure you select _THETA UVC Blender_ and not _RICOH THETA S_.

NOTE: In Skype, the video does not have 360 navigation (as of Oct 2016) and it will
look like a distorted rectangle. Skype is for testing only, not for use.
