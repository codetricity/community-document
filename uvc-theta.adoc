In the example above, the equirectangular video is shown streaming in
QuickTime. A video clip

After installation, you will need to connect a THETA that is powered off to register
the device. You may need to reboot. In my tests, I could not advance to the
UVC register step without a reboot. If I try and register the device without
a boot, I see a flashing _Establishing as Connection_ dialog, but the connection
is never completed.

If you need to reboot, run the THETA UVC Register application as administrator.

At this stage, you may need to reboot again. If you do, it is a one-time requirement.

Now, press power and mode to start the THETA S in live streaming mode. Test it
with a common video streaming application such as Google Hangout.

Go into the settings of Google Hangout to select the THETA UVC Blender webcam.

Here's an example with
https://obsproject.com/[Open Broadcaster Software].

Create a new Scene called _THETA Test_. Right click in _Sources_ to _Add_ a
new _Video Capture Device_

image::img/livestreaming/obs-video-capture.png[role="thumb" title="Add THETA S as Video Capture Device to OBS"]

Under the _Device Selection_ window, select _THETA UVC Blender_. Click _OK_.

The video stream will fill a portion of the screen. Select _Edit Scene_ to size the video stream to fit.

Ideally, I would like to test the output to a streaming server like the one shown below.

I don't have access to something like LiveShell or VidiU Teradek. I'm also now sure
how the navigation of the video would work.
