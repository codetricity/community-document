== 360 Video Formats

Video is stored on the camera in dual fish-eye mode.

The dual-fisheye MP4 file has an image size of 1920x1080 or 1280x720.

The official RICOH desktop app will convert this to equirectangular
mode. By default, the program will take your file name and add `_er` to it.
The file is saved in the same directory that the original video file was in.

Both the input and output are `.mp4` format videos.

image::img/video/dual_fish_eye.png[role="thumb" title="dual fish eye video format"]

The program will convert it to equirectangular. Note that there is
a minor color shading difference on the right side of the screen grab.
The camera has two lenses. Each lens captures and saves one sphere.
The software on the computer stitches the image together. The RICOH
app adds the meta video meta data in for you.

NOTE: if you use something like Adobe Premiere Pro to edit your videos, you will need to https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631?hl=en[inject the meta data] again

image::img/video/equirectangular_video.png[role="thumb" title="equirectangular video format"]

You can now load the video up to YouTube to your normal channel.  YouTube
will grab the meta data and add the 360 degree video controls automatically.
This is cool!

image::img/video/youtube_360.png[role="thumb" title="YouTube 360 video"]

https://youtu.be/MXX_JjQdtmE[Try it out].

NOTE: I've successfully tested the YouTube viewer on Windows and Mac with different browsers and on Linux with FireFox. It does not appear to work on Linux with Chrome.


== Video Live Streaming
The THETA S can stream video when connected to a USB or HDMI cable.
The output is in dual fish-eye mode (two spheres). To make the video
usable in a web browser or with external services,
you'll need to convert the video into equirectangular mode.

To view a live streaming video with 360 degree navigation, you can connect it
to a YouTube live streaming event.

CAUTION: YouTube live streaming needs to be an *Event* and not *Stream now*. You must check *This live stream is 360* under the *Advanced Settings* tab.

Follow this guide for
http://lists.theta360.guide/t/theta-live-streaming-on-youtube/13[RICOH THETA 360 degree live streaming on YouTube].

.Table of Pros and Cons for each Live Streaming Method
|===
|Live Stream Type |Pro |Con |Community Implementation

|USB equirectangular
|easy. appears as webcam to your application
|Low resolution (720). Slow framerate (15fps)
|Looking forward to seeing this after release! Hope they output to HDMI

|HDMI conversion to equirectangular
|highest resolution and framerate. Most common input for broadcast equipment
|difficult. no packaged solution. people are building their own.
|most people using Unity and then connecting to third-party equipment for live event broadcasting

|USB dual-fisheye
|easy. appears as webcam. higher resolution than equirectangular. less load on CPU.
|It's in dual-fisheye, so you'll need to build an application to process it
|Experimenting with facial and object recognition, suveillance

|WiFi Live View
|Works over WiFi. equirectangular.
|low resolution. slow. not designed for live streaming, just preview
|preview scenes

=== Examples with 3D Tools such as Unity and Maya LT
Nora, @steroarts, released a shader pack to convert THETA 360 degree
media into equirectangular format in real time.

* https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7131835/Programs/ThetaS_LiveView_Sample.unitypackage[Shader Pack]

The developer below, Goroman, was able to get reasonable 360 video live streaming in equirectangular mode
after an hour of work back in September, 2015. Additional information in
http://tips.hecomi.com/entry/2015/10/11/211456[Japanese is here].

== Image Viewers
The RICOH THETA S will will generate a equirectangular JPEG file of
5376x2688 or 2048x1024.

=== Example in Processor language

* https://pannellum.org/[Pannellum]
* http://www.vrhabitat.com/#vr5[VR5 Pano Viewer]

include::graphicTech.adoc[]

== Linux
RICOH only supports Mac and Windows desktop. As many developers use
Linux, we've collected some information from the community to help
people with basic tasks.

Linux can be used to control the camera HTTP API. There are also a number of
scripts to get media from the camera.

Tips from the community:

* YouTube 360 videos work with Firefox on Linux. Some people have had problems with FireFox
* If you're running Linux in VirtualBox as a guest, turn off 3D hardware acceleration
* There are a large number of viewers at the
http://wiki.panotools.org/Panorama_Viewers[Panotools.org] site. I've been using
http://www.fsoft.it/FSPViewer/[FSPViewer].

If you want to use Linux to
download media from the THETA and view it on your Linux box,
you can use Wine for image viewing using the
THETA Windows app or use a third-party application, Pano2VR.

Documentation below contributed by Svendus

SphericalViewer.exe opens and installs with Wine
It runs and you can view Spherical images, but videos are not converted.

Linux users can also import the files and use Pano2VR5.

== Proprietary Technical Information

=== Lens Parameter Information
The lens geometry for the THETA is based on equidistant projection.
The final projection
style for both videos and images is equirectangular projection.
RICOH does not make detailed lens parameter information available. This is
also known as lens distortion data. Developers often ask for this
information to improve stitching. It is proprietary and not available
as of December 2015. Stitching is still possible without this information.

=== Stitching Libraries
The RICOH THETA S processes still images inside of the camera. It
takes 8 seconds for the camera to be ready to take another still
image.

The videos are stored in dual-fisheye format (two spheres). The
official RICOH applications will convert this into equirectagular
format on either mobile devices or desktop computers. This format
can then be viewed locally or uploaded to YouTube, Facebook, or
other sites.

The source code and algorithms to perform this stitching
are not available to developers.

As of December 2015, there is no way to use the RICOH
libraries in live streaming mode.

== FAQ for Media Editing
=== Q: How do I edit video in Adobe Premiere Pro?
*A:*

1. Download dual-fisheye media file to your computer
2. Convert with official RICOH THETA desktop application. File name will
end in _er
3. Edit in Premiere Pro. Change audio track or add special effects with After Effects
4. On your desktop computer https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631?hl=en[inject metadata] again using another tool.
5. Upload to YouTube or other 360 degree video player or site

=== Q: How do I edit a still image in Photoshop or other image editing software?
Example of use: The photographer wants to lighten an image.

*A:*
DennisMabrey wrote a
https://developers.theta360.com/en/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=482[guide on how to add metadata for the image back into the still image].

Here is the 'workflow':

* Edit your JPEG in Photoshop
* EXPORT as JPEG to a NEW FILE. Do not overwrite the original (heck back it up or something).
* Run EXifToolGUI
* Select the exported JPEG file
* Select Menu option Modify/Remove Metadata
* Select the top option '-remove ALL metadata' and click 'Execute' button
* Make sure your exported JPEG file is still selected
* Select Menu option 'Export/Import'/Copy metadata into JPG or TIFF.
* In the File Dialog select the ORIGINAL panorama JPG file.
* Make sure ALL options are selected and click 'Execute'
* If you look at the Metadata tag with the ALL button clicked you should see both a section labeled 'Ricoh' AND one labeled 'XMP-GPano' (Googles XMP pano)
* Test the exported JPG in the RICOH program. Hopefully it worked.

=== Q: How do I connect the camera as a USB storage device?
*A:* Hold the WiFi and Shutter buttons on your camera while you plug the camera
into the USB port of your computer. The camera will appear as RICODCX. This is
generally more of a problem on Macs. Make sure you turn off auto-import into
Photos. People have experienced problems with importing the 360 images
into Photos. Save them to disk and use the RICOH app.

=== Q: What are the technical specifications of images and video?
*A:* The
https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/introduction/[official RICOH site]
has great information in the overview section.
