== Official Information

* https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/v2/api_reference/[RICOH THETA API v2],
compliant with
https://developers.google.com/streetview/open-spherical-camera/[Open Spherical Camera API version 1.0] from Google.
* https://developers.theta360.com/en/forums/[THETA Developers Official Forum]
* https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/sdk/[Official SDK]
* https://theta360.com/en/support/download/[Windows, Mac, iOS, Android apps]

== Video Live Streaming
The THETA S can stream video when connected to a USB or HDMI cable.
The output is in dual fish-eye mode (two spheres). To make the video
usable in a web browser or with exernal services such as YouTube,
you'll need to convert the video into equirectangular mode. To view it with
360 degree navigation, you'll need to stitch it.

=== Example with Processor Language
Community Contribution from Sunao Hashimoto, kougaku on GitHub. Full
sample source code is available.

The example above is built with https://processing.org/[Processing].

Additional information is on his http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kougaku-navi/[blog post in Japanese].

=== Examples with Unity
Nora, @steroarts, released a shader pack to convert THETA 360 degree
media into equirectangular format in real time.

The developer below, Goroman, was able to get reasonable 360 video live streaming in equirectangular mode
after an hour of work back in September, 2015. Additional information in
http://tips.hecomi.com/entry/2015/10/11/211456[Japanese is here].

Once the video is streamed in equirectangular mode, viewers such as VR Gear
or a browser using YouTube 360 can stitch the image.

== Linux
RICOH only supports Mac and Windows desktop. As many developers use
Linux, we've collected some information from the community to help
people with basic tasks.

Linux can be used to control the camera HTTP API. There are also a number of
scripts to get media from the camera.

If you want to use Linux to
download media from the THETA and view it on your Linux box,
you can use Wine for image viewing using the
THETA Windows app or use a third-party application, Pano2VR.

Documentation below contributed by Svendus

SphericalViewer.exe opens and installs with Wine
It runs and you can view Spherical images, but videos are not converted.

Linux users can also import the files and use Pano2VR5.

== Command Line

from Ulrich Rossgoderer. Community.

== Programming Languages
The HTTP API of the THETA S can be accessed from almost any programming language.

== Proprietary Technical Information

=== Lens Parameter Information
The lens geometry for the THETA is based on equidistant projection.
The final projection
style for both videos and images is equirectangular projection.
RICOH does not make detailed lens parameter information available. This is
also known as lens distortion data. Developers often ask for this
information to improve stitching. It is proprietary and not available
as of December 2015. Stitching is still possible without this information.
